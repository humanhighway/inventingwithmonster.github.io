Or CSS hover styles enabling on taps. Or sticky hover states when you’re merely trying to scroll the page. Or or or…</p>\n<p>If Apple had the bravery to break Flash websites, where was this bravery with hover interactions? Just break them, stick to a standard, the web will fix itself.</p>\n<p>Now, ten years later, we’re still stuck with this.

Etc.</p>\n<p>IMO the biggest problem is the flagrant abuse of power. Google has a special AMP section at the top of their search results, where AMP results get a nice picture. It’s labeled “Top stories”, but realistically it’s just a carousel of sell-outs. Not that you can blame them.</p>\n<p>Mobile browser usage is, on some sites, far higher than desktop. Yet can you imagine if Google created a special standard for desktop sites and showcased those at the top of their results? There’d be outrage. It’d be a clear power play. But this is just the shitty mobile web, so who cares, right?</p>\n<p>Now, there’s no denying that AMP pages are faster than the majority of the net and this definitely has some value for the user. AMP isn’t magic though, and if a normal site is fast enough to be featured, why not include those, too?</p>\n<p>We can’t complain, though.
